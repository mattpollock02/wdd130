            <h1>Common Questions</h1>
            <button class="accordion">Why will visitors come to this site?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Visitors will come to Matthew Pollock’s portfolio site to gain a comprehensive understanding of his
                    expertise, skills, and what he can uniquely offer as a professional. They’ll be drawn to the site by
                    the need to assess his qualifications for a project, view past work, and understand what sets him
                    apart from others in his field. By exploring the site, they hope to gauge whether Matthew's style
                    and skill set align with their needs and expectations. Visitors are likely to have questions like:
                    “What are Matthew’s areas of expertise?” “What past projects has he completed?” and “How can I
                    contact or hire him?” They might also want to see samples of his work, a summary of his professional
                    background, or a clear breakdown of services offered.

                    
                    Visitors will likely have a range of questions. They may want to know, “What specific areas of
                    expertise does Matthew Pollock have?” “What are some examples of projects he’s successfully
                    completed?” “What services does he offer, and are they relevant to my needs?” “What kind of clients
                    or industries has he worked with?” and “How do I get in touch or begin a collaboration?” They’ll
                    also be interested in practical details like his work process, testimonials from previous clients,
                    and perhaps his availability or pricing structure. Having these questions answered directly will
                    make it easier for potential clients or collaborators to assess if Matthew is the right fit for
                    their needs.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Main activities on this site</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The main activities visitors will want to complete on the site are viewing Matthew’s portfolio,
                    reading his bio, and reaching out to him. Some may want to download his resume or explore case
                    studies that give detailed insights into his approach and solutions for past projects. Others may be
                    interested in connecting via a contact form, booking a consultation, or signing up for updates if he
                    has a newsletter. For these actions, the site needs to be clear and accessible, with essential
                    information like a portfolio of work, a downloadable resume or qualifications summary, and contact
                    information readily available.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Why would people choose this site over others?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>People will choose Matthew’s site over others because it will offer a personal, authentic touch that
                    showcases not just his technical abilities, but also his passion and commitment. This distinct
                    approach will differentiate his site from generic portfolio templates by highlighting the unique
                    value he brings to each project. Additionally, a user-friendly layout with intuitive navigation will
                    make it easy for visitors to quickly find relevant information, increasing the likelihood that they
                    will stay and engage. By featuring testimonials, detailed case studies, and insights into his
                    creative or professional process, Matthew’s site will offer a meaningful, transparent view of his
                    work that builds trust and encourages potential clients or collaborators to reach out, ultimately
                    making his portfolio site a valuable and engaging resource.</p>
